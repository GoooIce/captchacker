= Getting started =

== Simple test: Egoshare GUI == 
As we have already downloaded some captchas, and build some SVM models, you can simply run the program:

   * Egoshare`_`4`_`GUI.py

Once you have launched the GUI, you should something similar to this:

You select a captcha, a model, and see if it breaks the captcha.

=== Requirements ===

Here is what you need to be able to do this test:
  * A python interpreter
  * [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ PIL (Python Image Library)] installed


== How to get captchas and train models myself ? ==

To continue with the Egoshare example, if you want to do the whole stuff yourself, it is fairly simple. Indeed, all you have to do is running the files Egoshare`_`n`_*`.py, namely:

  * Egoshare`_`1`_`GetCaptchas.py
  * Egoshare`_`1`_`bis`_`GetLabelledCaptchas.py
  * Egoshare`_`2`_`GenerateDB.py
  * Egoshare`_`3`_`TrainTestSVM.py
  * Egoshare`_`4`_`GUI.py
  * Egoshare`_`5`_`TestPerf.py

== What about other captchas? ==

The principle remain the same, for Hotmail, you have to run the Hotmail`_`n`_*`.py files: 
  * Hotmail`_`1`_`GetCaptchas.py
  * Hotmail`_`2`_`GenerateDB.py
  * Hotmail`_`3`_`TrainTestSVM.py
  * Hotmail`_`4`_`GUI.py
  * Hotmail`_`5`_`ComputeScores.py

Once more, you can just run Hotmail`_`4`_`GUI.py if you want to do a simple test.

== And what if I want/need to recompile the C++ sources? ==

The C++ sources have been compiled on Windows and Ubuntu, on i386 32bits architectures, and the binaries have been placed in the root directory.

Most users do *not* have to do this, however if you need/want to recompile these sources, here is what you need:

  * A C++ compiler
  * the C++ OpenCV library (do not forget the link options to be able to compile).
