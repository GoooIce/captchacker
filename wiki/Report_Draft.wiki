== Introduction ==
A CAPTCHA is a program that can generate and grade tests that humans can pass but current computer programs cannot. 

The term CAPTCHA (for Completely Automated Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart) was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper and John Langford of Carnegie Mellon University. At the time, they developed the first CAPTCHA to be used by Yahoo.

CAPTCHAs are widely used, here are some of the common applications: prevention of spam comment, website registration protection, online polls, dictionary attacks prevention, search engine bots, worms and spam...

== Problem studied ==

We decided to focus on several captcha types, from basic ones to much more complicated.

Firstly, we studied captchas from Egoshare.com, that can easily be segmented (by thresholding and connected components segmentations).
